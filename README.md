# ☕ Coffee Sales Analysis and Forecasting Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and forecasting project based on a coffee sales dataset . The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forecasting, and regression modeling to understand trends and predict future sales.

## 📊 Project Summary

In this project:
- Hourly, daily and monthly sales analysis
- Coffee type popularity analysis
- Payment method distribution
- Sales forecasting models
- 14-day sales projections

were performed.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Understand sales patterns and trends of coffee products.
- Identify key factors influencing coffee sales.
- Forecast future sales using **Facebook Prophet**.
- Compare regression models (LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict sales.

## 📦 Requirements
python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

lightgbm

fbprophet

scikit-learn
